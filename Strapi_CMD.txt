Here are two base commands to make a new project in strapi and to run it on localhost:1337

npx create-strapi-app@latest <project_name> --quickstart

This will create everything needed to get started with strap api creation. 

To launch strapi, from the project folder, create a new terminal window by right clicking and choosing New Terminal Window from folder. Paste the following command in the terminal window. 

nom run develop

This will initialize that project in strapi.

NOTE: If another instance is running it will occupy port 1337. You will need to shut down all instances of strap and re-run.
