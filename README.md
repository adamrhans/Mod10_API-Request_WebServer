# Creating API's and Sending Request to Web Server
---
#### Data Engineering Tools Used:
- Creating an API with Strapi
- Sending GET request and POST request to that API using POSTMAN
- Creating a Python project that will communicate with the Web Server on our Local Machine

#### Overview:
For this moduleâ€™s final assignment, I will create an API for flight information, using Strapi. I will then showcase sending GET and POST request to the API using POSTMAN. From POSTMAN, I will be able to generate a python code for an application that can be used to send these request programatically. 

#### Files Included: 
I have included screenshots of the API creation in Strapi, the request from POSTMAN and finally the flight.py python file.
