# Creating API's and Sending Request to Web Server
---
#### Data Engineering Tools Used:
- Using Docker to create a container to run Strapi on port 1337.
- Creating an API with [Strapi](https://strapi.io)
- Sending GET request and POST request to that API using [POSTMAN](https://www.postman.com/)
- Creating a Python project that will communicate with the Web Server on our Local Machine

#### Overview:
For this moduleâ€™s final assignment, I will create an API for flight information, using Strapi. I will then showcase sending GET and POST request to the API using POSTMAN. From POSTMAN, I will be able to generate a python code for an application that can be used to send these request programatically. 

#### Files Included: 
I have included [screenshots](https://github.com/adamrhans/Mod10_API-Request_WebServer/blob/main/Hans_Module10_FinalAssignment.docx) of the API creation in Strapi, the request from POSTMAN and finally the flight.py python file.
